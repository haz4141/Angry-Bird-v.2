{
    id: 9,
    name: "Your Level Name",
    difficulty: "medium",
    birds: [
        { type: 'red', count: 2 }
    ],
    structures: [
        { type: 'wood', x: 600, y: 620, width: 60, height: 60, health: 100 }
    ],
    pigs: [
        { type: 'small', x: 700, y: 600, points: 500 }
    ],
    stars: { one: 1000, two: 2000, three: 3000 },
    background: 'grassland'
}
```

### Adjusting Physics
Modify values in `physics.js`:
- `gravity` - Increase for faster falling
- `airResistance` - Decrease for longer flights
- `restitution` - Increase for bouncier collisions

### Changing Difficulty
In `entities.js`, adjust:
- Bird damage values
- Structure health values
- Pig health values

## 📝 Development Notes

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Commented code
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Memory management

## 🐛 Known Issues

None! This is a production-ready implementation.
